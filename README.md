An exploration of Planet Money's complete catalog.

## Motivation

[Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money/) is an American podcast and blog produced by NPR in association with Chicago Public Media. The podcast began in September 2008 and initially covered the 2008 financial crisis.

The podcast is a great resource (e.g., for studying the 2008 crisis), but old episodes can be hard to find. The goal of this project is to make it easy to find every Planet Money episode, and also to explore the podcast's catalog.
