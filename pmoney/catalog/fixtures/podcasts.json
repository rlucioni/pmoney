Ok, it's not that famous. But it's still worth looking at: The break-up of the Austro-Hungarian currency union in 1918. Just as the countries of Europe today share the euro, the Austrian empire and the Kingdom of Hungary had created a shared currency: the Austro-Hungarian crown. After World War I, the region broke up. All of a sudden there were lots of countries wanting to switch to their own currencies. At the beginning, they used a simple system: Countries simply stamped existing Austro-Hungarian currency with particular markings to turn it into new, domestic currency. Some countries used ornate samps; Romania's stamp was just a cross. This quickly led to chaos. Everyone wanted to get their money stamped in the country they thought would have the strongest currency. Countries sealed their borders, but it was no use. \"You had boxcar loads of currency\" moving across borders, says Michael Spencer, an economist who has written about this period. It turns out, killing a currency is hard to do. *\u00c2\u00a0Note: Today's podcast is a rerun.

On one side were people making what seems like the straightforward argument: People who get Medicaid fare better than people who don't. On the other side were those making the contrarian argument. They argued that there is already a safety net for the poor and the uninsured, and that Medicaid's reimbursement rates are so low that most doctors don't see Medicaid patients anyway. The debate was perennial and unresolvable. You couldn't simply compare people with Medicaid to those without, because the two groups had different characteristics. To truly answer the question, you would need to take a big group of people, and randomly divide them into two groups. One group would get Medicaid, and the other wouldn't. But doing that would be unethical. Then, a few years back, Oregon announced that it had 10,000 new slots in its Medicaid program. Far more than 10,000 people wanted to enroll. So the state held a lottery. The state of Oregon didn't mean to be creating the perfect experiment to test whether Medicaid actually helps people. But that's what it was doing. Katherine Baicker, a health economist at Harvard, followed people who entered the Oregon Medicaid lottery \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and she compared the outcomes between those who were given Medicaid, and those who were denied.

Keynes wrote about the idea of stimulus in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. His theory simply put, was this -- sometimes economies go into a recession and they can't get out, they get stuck in a kind of recession whirlpool and the best way to get them out is a swift kick by the government in the form of spending.

On today's Planet Money, Satyajit Das explains that European countries aren't actually putting their own money into that big euro-zone bailout fund. Instead, the fund will borrow from investors around the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the same investors who are growing wary of lending to a bunch of countries in Europe. What's more, the fund will be guaranteed by the countries that use the euro. So the more the fund is used, the more countries that are already struggling \u00e2\u20ac\u201d countries like Spain and Italy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d will be on the hook for potential losses.

It's still very possible that one or more rating agencies will downgrade the country's credit rating. On today's show we ask: Would a downgrade matter? We revisit a question we asked last year: How do you rate a country? And we talk to one expert who says a downgrade of America's credit rating would make for splashy headlines, but would likely have a relatively small impact. Most of America's debt is held by big institutional investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and those investors do their own research, and don't tend to be swayed much by what rating agencies say.", "embed_url": "www.npr.org/player/embed/138726749/380541062", "download_url": "http://play.podtrac.com/npr-510289/npr.mc.tritondigital.com/NPR_510289/media/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510289/138726749/npr_138726749.mp3?orgId=1&p=510289&story=138726749&t=podcast&e=138726749&siteplayer=true&dl=1", "created": "2016-08-20T01:26:56.710Z", "modified": "2016-08-20T01:26:56.710Z"}}]
